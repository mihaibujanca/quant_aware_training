# Notebooks

Exploratory notebooks. Plots output to `plots/`.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `error_tracking_viz.ipynb` | Visualizes error decomposition through network layers: rounding error, ReLU flip error, and accumulation patterns. |
| `geometric_entropy.ipynb` | Explores the relationship between quantization error volume, entropy, and geometry. Studies how error shape changes through linear vs nonlinear layers. |
| `quantization_geometry2D.ipynb` | 2D visual exploration of quantization error regions. Traces how error polytopes evolve through layers, with manifold comparisons. |
| `quantization_geometry3D.ipynb` | 3D error geometry experiments. Diagonal/random weight matrices, ReLU effects, error growth tracking, sensitivity analysis. |
